New [\#JAMstack](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JAMstack?src=hashtag_click) blog using [@eleven_ty](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty) with [@NetlifyCMS](https://twitter.com/NetlifyCMS), the site deployed to[ @Netlify](https://twitter.com/Netlify) through[ @github](https://twitter.com/github) git-gateway with no drama. 

To avoid Git Gateway Error when trying to login to CMS, be sure to **set the backend branch to the correct branch** of your GitHub repository in config.yml
